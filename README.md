# 201-assign0
The first project for my CS201 class, Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It contains classes and headers for a singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, and queue, as well as a makefile.

Instructions:

To build all: make

To build individually: 
  - make test-sll
  - make test-dll
  - make test-stack
  - make test-queue
  
To test:
  1. make
  2. make test
  
To clean: make clean

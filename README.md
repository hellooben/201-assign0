# 201-assign0
The first project for my CS201 class, Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It contains classes and headers for a singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, and queue, as well as a makefile.

### Header/Class Files are:
  - sll.h/sll.c
  - dll.h/sll.c
  - stack.h/stack.c
  - queue.h/queue.c
  
Any files other than these, and the makefile, are test files. You may update the makefile to run different tests as you please.

### Instructions:

To build all: make

To build individually: 
  - make test-sll
  - make test-dll
  - make test-stack
  - make test-queue
  
To test:
  1. make
  2. make test
  
To clean: make clean

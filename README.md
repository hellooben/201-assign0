# 201-assign0
The first project for my CS201 class, Data Structures and Algorithms. 
It contains classes and headers for a singly linked list, doubly linked list, stack, and queue, as well as a makefile.

### Header/Class Files I wrote are:
  - integer.h/integer.c
  - sll.h/sll.c
  - dll.h/sll.c
  - stack.h/stack.c
  - queue.h/queue.c
  
These classes work with any generic data type. The INTEGER/REAL/STRING classes are used to test integer, real, and string values. Files such as sll-0-0.c are test files.

### Instructions:

To build all: make

To build individually: 
  - make test-sll
  - make test-dll
  - make test-stack
  - make test-queue
  
To test:
  1. make
  2. make test
  
To clean: make clean
